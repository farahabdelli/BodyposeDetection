 Building body pose based apps with Mediapipe and Python! I used the basics for getting
 started with Body pose detection, facial landmark estimation and hand pose detection using a single 
 Mediapipe library and my webcam.

STEPS : 
1. Install Mediapipe and setup Mediapipe Holistic for Python
2. Access a real time video feed from my webcam using OpenCV
3. Detect and visualise facial landmarks, body poses and hand poses
